				    <h1>What is M.Sc. Mathematics?</h1>
					MSc Mathematics is a two-year postgraduate program which is being divided into four semesters. This degree has been awarded to those who complete the program. In this degree, candidates get a deeper knowledge of advanced mathematics through a vast preference of subjects such as geometry, calculus, algebra, number theory, dynamical systems, differential equations, etc. The students become more skilled and specialized in a particular subject after the master degree program. In this course, students learn to collect big data and analyse them with the help of different tools and methods. <br>
					<h1>Courses in Mathematics</h1>
					MSc Mathematics have two types of courses. One is the postgraduate course in Mathematics and another one is combined with the Computer Science Applications. In the MSc Mathematics, students get a deep insight into pure and applied mathematics. Students learn about the problem-solving skills and reasoning skills which helps them to solve them the real-life problems. In other types of postgraduate, the students learn about modelling and solving real-world problems with the help of computer applications. Computational Mathematics is one of the prominent subjects through which candidate learn to solve mathematical problems with the help of computer simulation which is opposite to the analytic methods of applied mathematics.<br>
					<h1>Eligibility criteria for these courses</h1><br>
					The minimum eligibility criteria for the MSc Mathematics course is student should have passed B.Sc. (Mathematics) or B.Sc. (Mathematics with Computer Science Applications) or any other relevant degree with Mathematics and English as main subjects with a minimum of 60% marks. The minimum percentage varies from University to University. Some institutes also consider the B.Tech and B.E candidates. Few universities take admission in the postgraduate course through the merit basis and some institutes through the merit basis.<br>
